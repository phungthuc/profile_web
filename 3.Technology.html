                        <p>An automatic watch, also known as self-winding watch, is a mechanical watch in which the
                            natural motion of the wearer provides energy to run the watch, making manual winding
                            unnecessary. It is distinguished from a manual watch in that a manual watch, while also
                            having no internal battery, must have its main spring wound by hand at regular intervals.
                            <br>A self-winding watch movement has a mechanism which winds the mainspring using the
                            natural motions of the wearer's body. The watch contains an oscillating weight that turns
                            on a pivot. The normal movements of the watch in the user's pocket or on the user's arm
                            cause the rotor to pivot on its staff, which is attached to a ratcheted winding
                            mechanism. The motion of the watch is thereby translated into circular motion of the
                            weight which, through a series of reverser and reducing gears, eventually winds the
                            mainspring. There are many different designs for modern self-winding mechanisms. Some
                            designs allow winding of the watch to take place while the weight swings in only one
                            direction while other, more advanced, mechanisms have two ratchets and wind the mainspring
                            during both clockwise and anti-clockwise weight motions.</p>

                        <p>A mechanical watch is a watch that uses a clockwork mechanism to measure the passage of time,
                            as opposed to quartz watches which function electronically via a small battery. A mechanical
                            watch is driven by a mainspring which must be wound either periodically by hand or via an
                            automatic winding mechanism. Its force is transmitted through a series of gears to power the
                            balance wheel, a weighted wheel which oscillates back and forth at a constant rate. A device
                            called an escapement releases the watch's wheels to move forward a small amount with each
                            swing of the balance wheel, moving the watch's hands forward at a constant rate. The
                            escapement is what makes the 'ticking' sound which is heard in an operating mechanical
                            watch. Mechanical watches evolved in Europe in the 17th century from spring powered clocks,
                            which appeared in the 15th century.

                        <p>A quartz clock is a clock that uses an electronic oscillator that is regulated
                            by a quartz crystal to keep time. This crystal oscillator creates a signal with
                            very precise frequency, so that quartz clocks are at least an order of magnitude
                            more accurate than mechanical clocks. Generally, some form of digital logic counts
                            the cycles of this signal and provides a numeric time display, usually in units
                            of hours, minutes, and seconds.
                            <br>The world's first quartz clock was built in 1927 by Warren Marrison and J. W. Horton
                            at Bell Telephone Laboratories. The world's first quartz watch, however, was unveiled by
                            Seiko as the Astron in December 1969. Since the 1980s, when the advent of solid-state
                            digital electronics allowed them to be made compact and inexpensive, quartz timekeepers have
                            become the world's most widely used timekeeping technology, used in most clocks and watches
                            as
                            well as computers and other appliances that keep time.</p>

                        <p>Clock quartz crystals are manufactured in an ultra-clean environment and protected by an
                            inert
                            ultra-high-vacuum
                            environment in hermetically sealed containers. Still the frequency of a quartz crystal can
                            slowly change over time
                            causing the frequency to increase or decrease over time. The effect of ageing is much
                            smaller
                            than the effect of frequency
                            variation caused by temperature changes and manufactures can estimate its effects.
                            <br>Generally, the ageing effect eventually
                            decreases the frequency. Factors that can cause a small frequency drift over time are stress
                            relief in the mounting structure,
                            loss of hermetic seal, contaminations contained in the crystal lattice, moisture absorption,
                            changes in or on the quartz crystal,
                            severe shock and vibrations effects, exposure to very high temperatures. Crystal aging tends
                            to
                            be logarithmic meaning the maximum
                            rate of change of frequency occurs immediately after manufacture and decays thereafter.
                            <br>Most
                            of the aging will occur within the
                            first year of the crystals service life. Crystals do eventually stop aging (asymptotically),
                            but
                            it can take many years.
                            Movement manufacturers can pre-age crystals before assembling them into clock movements. To
                            promote accelerated ageing the
                            crystals are exposed to high temperatures. <br>If a crystal is pre-aged, the manufacturer
                            can
                            measure its ageing rates
                            (strictly, the coefficients in the ageing formula) and have a microcontroller calculate out
                            the
                            corrections over time. The
                            initial calibration of a movement will stay accurate longer if the crystals are pre-aged.
                            The
                            advantage would end after subsequent
                            regulation which will, reset any cumulative aging error to zero. A reason more expensive
                            movements tend to be more accurate is
                            that the crystals are pre-aged longer and selected for better ageing performance.
                            Sometimes individual crystals after pre-ageing are hand selected for high-accuracy movement
                            performance.</p>
                        <p>The piezoelectric properties of quartz were discovered by Jacques and Pierre Curie in 1880.

                            first quartz crystal
                            oscillator was built by Walter G. Cady in 1921. In 1923, D. W. Dye at the National Physical

                            Marrison at Bell Telephone Laboratories produced sequences of precision time signals with

                        by
                        the Centre Electronique Horloger
                        (CEH) in Neuchâtel Switzerland, and the prototype of the Astron revealed by Seiko in Japan
                        (Seiko
                        had been working on quartz clocks since
                        1958).<br>In December 1969, Seiko produced the world's first commercial quartz wristwatch, the
                        Seiko-Quartz Astron 35SQ
                        which is now honored with IEEE Milestone.[28] The Astron had a quartz oscillator with a
                        frequency of
                        8192 Hz and was
                        accurate to 0.2 seconds per day, 5 seconds per month, or 1 minute per year. The Astron was
                        released
                        less than a year
                        prior to the introduction of the Swiss Beta 21, which was developed by 16 Swiss Watch
                        manufacturers
                        and used by Rolex,
                        Patek and Omega in their electroquartz models. The inherent accuracy and low cost of production
                        has
                        resulted in the
                        proliferation of quartz clocks and watches since that time. By the 1980s, quartz technology had
                        taken over applications such as
                        kitchen timers, alarm clocks, bank vault time locks, and time fuzes on munitions, from earlier
                        mechanical balance wheel movements,
                        an upheaval known in watchmaking as the quartz crisis.<br>
                        Quartz timepieces have dominated the wristwatch and clock market since the 1980s. Because of the
                        high Q factor and low t
                        emperature coefficient of the quartz crystal, they are more accurate than the best mechanical
                        timepieces, and the elimination of
                        all moving parts makes them more rugged and eliminates the need for periodic maintenance.<br>
                        Commercial analog and digital wall clocks became available in 2014 that utilize a double oven
                        quartz
                        oscillator,
                        accurate to 0.2 ppb. These clocks are factory-synchronized with the atomic time standard and
                        typically do not require any
                        further time adjustments for the life of the clock.</p>
                    <p>
                        The next 3 decades saw the
                        development of quartz clocks as precision time standards in laboratory settings; the bulky
                        delicate counting electronics,
                        built with vacuum tubes, limited their use elsewhere. In 1932 a quartz clock was able to
                        measure
                        tiny variations in the rotation
                        rate of the Earth over periods as short as a few weeks. In Japan in 1932, Issac Koga
                        developed a
                        crystal cut that gave an oscillation
                        frequency with greatly reduced temperature dependence. The National Bureau of Standards (now
                        NIST) based the time standard of the US on
                        quartz clocks between the 1930s and the 1960s, after which it transitioned to atomic clocks.
                        The wider use of quartz clock technology had
                        to await the development of cheap semiconductor digital logic in the 1960s. The revised 14th
                        edition of
                        Encyclopaedia Britannica stated that quartz clocks would probably never be affordable enough
                        to
                        be used domestically.</p>
